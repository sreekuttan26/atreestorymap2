                <li>The pied kingfisher returns to Venkateshpura Lake. Watching it hover before diving to fish inspires hope.</li>
                <li>After restoration, biodiversity assessments revealed a mild dip in some species.</li>
                <li>These were short-term responses to habitat reformation; the ecosystem soon stabilised.</li>
                <li>Residential areas around the lake have not required a water tanker for over a year, showing the lake functions effectively as an aquifer.</li>
                <li>Walkers, both young and old, and enthusiastic birders are regular visitors to the lake.</li>
                <li>The lake has become a safe space for women to sit after work on hot afternoons.</li>
                <li>The water looks clearer and water quality metrics show improvement, but work is ongoing.</li>
                <li>Alterations to the inlets and outlets have disrupted the lake’s natural flow.</li>
                <li>A concrete extension to the outlet, intended to ensure year-round water, has restricted the lake’s drainage capability.</li>
                <li>This has led to backflow, making the lake susceptible to algal blooms and other issues that require continuous management.</li>
                <li>Water quality needs to remain consistent, particularly in summer when the lake recedes and dissolved oxygen levels can drop dangerously.</li>
                <li>The floating islands and newly planted vegetation demand regular care.</li>
                <li>Preventing illegal drainage into the lake and protecting the fragile historical GTS structure requires constant vigilance.</li>
                <li>Regrettably, the fence around the restored lake has excluded some key actors, such as migrants and pastoralists.</li>
